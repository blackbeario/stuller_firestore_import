Engine oil\\, spark plugs and air filter where all okay and the valves did not sound noisy. Generator was running at 243 vac at 62Hz\\, ran it under load for about 20 minutes and it didn’t shut down. Looks like it was overloaded at some point and didn’t start for this outage because of the fault. Couldn’t find anything mechanically wrong with this generator. \\nCustomer wants us to find a key for this gen.\\nGave them bill for 1 hour labor- $95\\, she will mail in check because she was late for work and had to leave. Gave her bill\\, she signed.\\n 3/22/19 Kon- First thing generator had an “undervoltage” fault light lit up on the control board\\, usually to reset this you’d turn the generator off and on again and the fault would clear but the fault would not clear. Turning it off didn’t make a difference and putting it into manual didn’t do anything either\\, generator would not start or run in manual. I decided to disconnect the battery and do a hard reset on the board\\, once the battery was connected again the generator started and ran even though the switch position was in “off”. The changing the switch position had no effect on the generator\\, I shut the gen down by turning fuel off and decided to disconnect the starter replay. Connected the battery and found voltage on the starter solenoid wire\\, I could also hear an audible “click” of a relay on the control board. \\nLooks to me like the board shorted out. I called Mr. Crow and explained this to him and told him we will get working on trying to find a replacement board. Left the generator fuel and starter unplugged\\, battery charger is hooked up to the battery so it wont die. \\n4/24/19 Replaced control board\\, gen started right up and ran well at 238vac at 60hz. No one was home so I couldn’t check the xfer panel\\, going to email invoice. Kon\\n5/4/19 Repair Kon- Took me a whire to figure this out\\, the transfer panel in this generator has one of those programmable outlets (one you would use for example Christmas lights\\, you program a time for it to come on then a time for it to turn off) that had two ice cube relays going to it. The relays are wired up to the 2 wire start on the gen. For some reason this outlet was programmed to come on around Thursday at 2pm then go off on Saturday around whatever time it was set on\\, ultimately making the generator exercise for two days. That’s why it started the Thursday after I replaced the board and just kept running.\\nI reset that timer with the correct current time then programmed it to start Thursdays at 2pm and shut off at Thursdays at 2:15pm.\\nWas out here for about an hour and a half\\, need to bill out cause they both left before I got done\\, I think Mr. Crow prefers email/ snail mail.

The external regulator had an indoor rated vent cap which was clogged up\\, replaced that then had to check and adjust the pressure on the external reg. Checked the internal fuel solenoid and cleaned off plunger\\, recommended customer to get a new external fuel regulator\\, when I adjusted it to the correct fuel pressure it would slowly creep up in pressure. He’s having the gas guys out on Tuesday\\, customer paid via visa for one hour labor and vent cap. V/5555\\n6/13/19 Tune Up Kon- Customer had issue again with generator not starting and opted to get a tune-up done\\, performed tune up service and generator started up within 2 tries. Last time I was out I recommended getting the external fuel regulator replaced and they called someone out\\, the person that came out did not replace the regulator they only replaced the vent cap. This does not make sense becasuse last time I was out I replaced the cap with an outdoor rated one\\, the person from the gas company replaced the outdoor one AGAIN with an indoor brass cap. Stupid. Called customer to tell him what was going on\\, when I tested the fuel pressure the gauge was pegged at max. Once adjusting down the pressure seamed to stay the same and the generator started up each time\\, the issue is that old external fuel reg by outputting too much fuel\\, once they fix this it should start up each time.

He agreed to do so and seemed pretty concerned about it\\, NEED to check up during the 12month visit. The vents are far enough away that it may not be a big deal but if the gen runs for a number of hours straight and the wind is blowing against the house it may become a problem. \\nCustomer pd through 6/2019","payment":"?","locations":{"billing":{},"primary":{"name":"home","address":"112 Valley Lake Trail","city":"Travelers Rest","state":"SC","zipcode":"29690","area":"Travelers Rest","generators":{"gen":{"generator":"1st @ 2pm","model":"ASPAS1CCA007","serial":"BPR6HS/0E9368 Gap 0.03\"","battery age":"Sundays @ 8am","xfer location":"?","xfer serial":"","spark plugs":"?","exercise time":"0E7585A","oil filter":"RC14YC/0E7585 Gap: 0.03\"","air filter":"Tuesdays @ 4pm","warranty":"?","location":"3/2014","wifi":""}}}}},"Scott Marks Guest House":{"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Marks Guest House","email":"smarksjr@alum.mit.edu","main":"3127180090","mobile":"","notes":"7/15/15 Start up\\n10/13/16 12m NC\\n12/29/16 pd for install.\\n1/29/18 12m NC emailed invoice\\, gen looks good.

Justin\\n ** AFTER WE DO HIS LAST SERVICE \\, DO NOT RENEW CONTRACT PER BRIAN !!! HE HAS RUDE/MEAN**\\n7/9/19 Repair Kon- Generator is acting very erratically\\, sometimes started up (sometimes doesn’t) the crank cycle is often interrupted by the starter\\, sometimes produces voltage and sometimes does not but it never runs more than a minute or two. I had a test controller board from an old generator that I used in it (to make sure that it wouldnt damage a new one) and the generator started up just fine and ran well with the test controller. Told the customer that its likely the controller since I have never seen a generator behave like this\\, have them the price and told them I have a used on with me\\, they opted for a new one (don’t have one with me and we may not have one at the shop because of the age of the unit) from the looks of it they may want to replace the unit\\, I will call and follow up on part availability and she will talk to her husband about replacing it and make a decision. I will follow up.

Fuel pressure is just above 8 water columns (should be 5-7 water columns) and I cannot adjust it down anymore because there are no more threads on the adjustment screw on the external regulator. Looking through the generator history the only time they experience “Overcrank” faults is during the really cold months. I suggested that they replace the external fuel regulator and cover it with something during the really cold months because its pretty exposed where it is located. My suggestion was to get a styrofoam cooler from walmart or something and cut out holes for the pipes\\, fit it over the regulator giving it air to breath and covering it from the elements.

She said the technician working on it stated that the engine dropped a rod and there was oil all over the bottom of the gen. When I came out I didn’t see any oil or signs of an oil leak ever occurring\\, the bottom of the gen hasn’t been cleaned and there is dirt everywhere (so if oil where ever cleaned up this would probably be cleaner). First thing I did was check valve clearance\\, did not find any damaged valves or dropped valve rods. Performed valve adjustment (they where not too bad\\, just a typical adjustment)\\, replaced with correct spark plugs and tried to start the engine. Sounded like it wasn’t getting air\\, found that the stepper motor was unplugged. Once I plugged the stepper motor back in the generator started and ran\\, about 20 seconds in there was a terrible racket. Sounded like one of the cylinders was interfering with a valve or something. Looking down into the cylinders at first glance there didn’t seem to be much damage\\, but at closer inspection (on the internal cylinder) I noticed a bunch of small indentations on one of the piston heads. \\nI asked the customer for records from Nicklson\\, one of the records say that a bolt from the throttle plate was missing and was likely in the engine. \\nFrom this I came to the conclusion that the small indentations on the cylinder are from that bolt and it is likely lodged into the top of the cylinder head. \\nAt this point I’m not sure that replacing the head is the right way to go\\, there may be cracks in the cylinder head that would only get bigger\\, or damage to the cylinder wall that would inevitably cause the piston rings to fail. \\nI called Generac to have the email us an Engine Request Form\\, once we fill it out we need to quote her on an engine replacement. \\nShe doesn’t seem keen on replacing the generator at this time and would like us to fix it.

One of the installation technicians (electrical or HVAC/gas) found that it had been set up to run on propane. When he changed the setting to propane\\, it worked fairly well for awhile.

Usually this is caused by the generator not producing the correct amount of voltage\\, so the control board doesn’t know that the engine is running. Unfortunately this time the generator started right up and ran just fine over and over\\, the customer said this is the second time its happened to him and the first time was last October during a power outage\\, but it has worked since he reset it then until about a week ago. This is an intermittent issue that I can diagnose until I can catch it. The generator produced around 245vac at 60hz\\, engine looked and sounded good and the resistance on the stator was 1 ohm and the rotor was about 20ohms. The resistance on the rotor should be around 15-17 so this is the only red flag that I got\\, being a bit high I told the customer that there is a chance its the brushes but I could not confirm this. I explained to them what it would take to replace the brushes and the labor involved but they said since it was working now and that I couldn’t guarantee it they didnt want me to replace the brushes today. They will keep listening for the exercise on Wednesdays and call us if this ever happens again.
